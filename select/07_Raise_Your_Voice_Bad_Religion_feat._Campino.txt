Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice

Don't be played like someone else's board game
Don't be classed out like some desperate redoubt
Don't be misled you've got a lot on your head
And nobody's gonna pay attention when you are dead

So
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice

It's the primary rule, you gotta wanna be fooled
It's our daunted restraint that keeps us silent in shame
It's our nature to be adversarial and free
Our evolution didn't hinge on passivity

So
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
Fa fa fafa fa fa fafa raise your voice
