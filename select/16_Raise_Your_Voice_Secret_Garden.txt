Though the night be dark and fearful
Though we face the dimming day
Though the heart be sad and tearful
Trust in Him, He will light the way
Raise your Voices!
Raise your voices!
praise to Him- the living word
To the heaven high ascending
Raise your voices to the Lord

Through the mists in this vale of sorrow
Through the glass we but darkly see
We will rise again tomorrow
Then, our eyes will lifted be
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
Praise to Him- the living word
To the heaven high ascending
Raise your voices to the Lord

Long the road that has no ending
Far the path that has no return
And the soul is ever wending

To the place it first was born

See the host of angels sing
When they hear that trumpet sound
When the piper's call is ringing
Than shall my soul be ever homeward bound
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
Praise to Him- the living word
To the heaven high ascending
Raise your voices to the Lord

Mountains tall and seas will thunder
One unceasing shorus sing
Heav'n and earth will sleep no longer
Than the universe as one will sing
Raise your voices!
Raise your voices!
Praise to Him- the living word
To the heaven high ascending
Raise your voices to the Lord!
Raise your voices to the Lord!
